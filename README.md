I had Create a Signup page for taking input from the user such as Username, Password, etc. and a Submit button. The webpage should contain the following validations :
* If user did not fill any field or put wrong length of password and clicked on the submit button, appropriate message should be displayed
I have designed it with  an interactive page having good CSS .
